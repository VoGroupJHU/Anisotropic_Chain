README for MC simulations

This folder contains files related to the implementation of our connectivity generalization to the Entropic Bonding Theory

Descriptions of files are:

1). Hoomd_script_file_octahedron_face-face-bonding_N_20.py
		Sample script for running a face-face connected chain of octahedral monomers of chain length N = 20

2). analyzing_code_octahedron_closesest_point_distribution.py
		Analysis code for closest point distribution from simulation results of polymer conformation

3). analyzing_code_Re_end_to_end_distance_calculation.py
		Analysis code for end-to-end distance calculation from simulation results of polymer conformation

4). octahedron_face_face_bonding_EQBL_0.1_N_20_gsd_file.gsd
		Sample trajectory data file for use in analysis scripts
